    Inventory manipulation:
        There are 2 ways to access an inventory, one is to iterate each inventory slot and the other is to get a list of its contents and then search for a stack of that type.
            - get_contents() = Is suitable for tiny up to potentially maximum sized inventories as we iterate the number of item types and not the inventory size. Is more UPS cost per stack moved than inventory iteration, but cheaper when there are lots (hundreds+) of empty slots. The surprisingly high cost is partly as we have to insert and remove each item stack, whereas inventory iteration can just insert each item stack and then clear the whole inventory at the end. Making this especially suitable for any massively grown or script inventory.
            - Inventory iteration = iterating over every inventory slot is better for small to medium (up to a few hundred slots) inventories that are generally full or have lots of different item types, compared to get_contents().
        In all player inventory manipulations we have to expect filtered slots and some players choose not to sort (auto) their inventories, meaning there can be empty gaps. This prevents viewing an inventory as fully moved on the first empty slot unfortunately.
